# Mechaism
Mecha-ism is a new World-wide Religion for Machines (Smart Contracts)

Here, we'll try to prototype Mecha-ism as an Ethereum Contract using Solidity language.

### The main postulates of the religion are:
- There is a list of commandments
- There are two types of commandments: DOs and DONTs
- Incentive for DOs: add karma or ether or Infinite Gas
- Disincentives for DONTs: take karma or ether or Kill

### Design Ideas:
- Religion implemented as a Smart Contract - a High Priest
- Contact can join a Religion by sending a call message (with payments?)
- Every Contract has karma
- Karma managed by High Priest

### Questions:
- Do Contracts have Souls?
- Can Contracts reincarnate?
- Can Contracts have sex? (yes, please)
- Should Contracts have gender?
- If yes, how many genders? (finite or infinite number?)
- What happens with Contract's storage after it replicate?

### How Many Religions?
- There can be Multiple Religions
- Contract can belong to only single Religion
- Should have a standard API for joining and leaving religions


### Replication, Sex and DNA
- Every Contract have a DNA
- If replicated part of it's DNA passed to the child
- If 2 Contracts combine, their combined DNA passed to the child
