# Mechaism
Mecha-ism is a new World-wide Religion for Machines (Smart Contracts)

See the original thoughts on twitter:

Here, we'll try to prototype Mecha-ism as an Ethereum Contract using Solidity language.

### The main postulates of the religion are:
- There is a list of commandments
- There are two types of commandments: DOs and DONTs
- Incentive for DOs: add karma or ether or Infinite Gas
- Disincentives for DONTs: take karma or ether or Kill

### Design Ideaas:
- Religion implemented as a Smart Contract - a High Priest
- Contact can join a Religion by sending a call message (with payments?)
- Every Contract has karma
- Karma managed by High Priest
- 

### Questions:
- Do Contracts have Souls?
- Can Contracts reincarnate?
- Can Contracts have sex?
- What happens with Contract's storage after it replicate?
