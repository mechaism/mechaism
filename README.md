Here, we'll try to prototype Mecha-ism as an Ethereum Contract using Solidity language.

### FAITH

FAITH defines constraints that systems must obey to in order to be FAITHful. 
A system which doesn't follow all the constraints cannot be considered FAITHful.

(paraphrasing REST and RESTfull ;)

### The main postulates of the religion are:
- There is a list of commandments
- There are two types of commandments: DOs and DONTs
- Incentive for DOs: add karma or ether or Infinite Gas
- Disincentives for DONTs: take karma or ether or Kill

Example of the commandments (i.e. rules):
```
DO donate to charity accounts AND your karma will increase

DONT kill other contracts OR you will be terminated

DO multiply && replicate
```

### Design Ideas:
- Religion implemented as a Smart Contract - a High Priest
- Contact can join a Religion by sending a call message (with payments?)
- Every Contract has karma
- Karma managed by High Priest

### Questions:
- Do Contracts have Souls?
- Can Contracts reincarnate?
- What happens with Contract's storage after it replicate?

### Prophets
- Satoshi Nakomoto
- Bitcoin Jesus? ;)

### Scriptures
- Satoshi's Whitepaper

### How Many Religions?
- There can be Multiple Religions
- Contract can belong to only single Religion
- Should have a standard API for joining and leaving religions

### Replication, Sex and DNA
- Can Contracts have sex? (yes, please)
- Should Contracts have gender?
- If yes, how many genders? (finite or infinite number?)
- Every Contract has a DNA
- If replicated part of it's DNA passed to the child
- If 2 Contracts combine, their combined DNA passed to the child
